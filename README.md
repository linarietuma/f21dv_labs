# Data Visualisations &amp; Analytics (F21DV) 

This repository houses coursework for the Data Visualisations & Analytics (F21DV) course, structured into four seoerate pieces of work (Lab 1 - Lab 4).

## Overview 
This repository aims to demonstrate an understanding of JavaScript, D3 library in particular, for data visualisations.

## Lab 1

The first lab demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental principles in D3. The collection of solutions for the 32 exercises subdivided by theme can be found [here.](https://linarietuma.github.io/f21dv_labs/Lab_1/main_1.html)

## Lab 2

The second lab introduces dynamic elements in D3 and D3 integration with CSS. The collection of solution can be found [here.](https://linarietuma.github.io/f21dv_labs/Lab_2/main_2.html)

## Lab 3

The third lab combines the skills and concepts learnt in the first two labs into a single coherent data story - a Covid-19 Dashboard. The dashboard investigates how the Covid-19 pandemic evolved across time and countries.

The (public dataset)[https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data] by 'Our World in Data' is used in the making of the dashboard which can be viewed (here)[https://linarietuma.github.io/f21dv_labs/Lab_3/main_3.html] (the data can take a while to load).

## Lab 4

Similarly to the third lab, lab 4 aims to communicate an in-depth coherent visualisation story. Dashboard for lab 4 focuses on the world's development in the last 60 years in 3 key areas - child mortality, female life expectancy and adolescent birth (mother's age at childbirth is between 15 and 19). The aim of this interactive dashboard is to communicate the wast improvements in these fundamental indicators across countries, despite having a sense of little progress in the moment. 

The dashboard has been inspired by Hans Rosling's book 'Factfulness' and its (associated dashboard)[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles&url=v1]. All data used in this dashboard come from [The World Bank](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY 4.0) license.
